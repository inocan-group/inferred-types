# Inferred Types

A collection of Typescript utilities which try to preserve as much strong and narrow typing as is possible. The repo's `src/` directory ia broken into a set of **runtime** utilities as well as pure **design-time** type utilities.

All utilities are tested for runtime and design-time correctness.
