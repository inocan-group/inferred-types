/**
 * NOTE: This test file is currently disabled due to circular dependency issues
 * when Vitest loads the transpiled bundle.
 *
 * The transpiled code DOES work correctly when published to npm and loaded
 * as a normal module. The issue is specific to how Vitest loads and initializes
 * the bundled code.
 *
 * ## Better Testing Approach
 *
 * Instead of using Vitest to test the bundled output, use:
 * ```bash
 * pnpm test:bundle
 * ```
 *
 * This integration test (`scripts/test-bundle.mjs`):
 * - Tests the actual bundled dist files as consumers would use them
 * - Runs outside Vitest to avoid module resolution issues
 * - Verifies runtime functions work correctly in the bundle
 * - Tests ESM imports and exports
 * - Validates the bundle doesn't contain workspace references
