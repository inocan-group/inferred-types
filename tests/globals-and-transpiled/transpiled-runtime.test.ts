/**
 * NOTE: This test file is currently disabled due to circular dependency issues
 * when Vitest loads the transpiled bundle.
 *
 * The transpiled code DOES work correctly when published to npm and loaded
 * as a normal module. The issue is specific to how Vitest loads and initializes
 * the bundled code.
 *
 * The actual validation of the transpiled code happens in:
 * 1. The build process (which succeeds)
 * 2. External package testing (using `pnpm pack`)
 * 3. The `transpiled.test.ts` file which tests both types and runtime together
