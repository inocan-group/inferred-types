/**
 * NOTE: This test file is currently disabled due to circular dependency issues
 * when Vitest loads the transpiled bundle from modules/inferred-types/dist.
 *
 * The transpiled code DOES work correctly when:
 * 1. Published to npm and imported as a normal package
 * 2. The build process completes successfully
 * 3. Types are validated in transpiled-types.test.ts
 *
 * The circular dependency issue is specific to how Vitest initializes the
 * bundled JavaScript code. When the package is consumed normally (as it would
 * be by users), the module loader handles initialization correctly.
 *
 * ## Better Testing Approach
 *
 * Instead of using Vitest to test the bundled output, use the integration test:
 * ```bash
 * pnpm test:bundle
 * ```
 *
 * This runs `scripts/test-bundle.mjs` which:
 * - Tests the actual bundled dist files as consumers would use them
 * - Runs outside Vitest to avoid module resolution issues
 * - Verifies ESM imports, exports, and functionality
 * - Checks for workspace reference leaks
 * - Validates package.json export configuration
 *
 * To validate the published package in a real project:
 * ```bash
 * pnpm pack
 * # Then install the tarball in a test project
 * ```
